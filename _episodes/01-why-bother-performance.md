## What is software performance?

(FIXME)

## Why is software performance important?

(FIXME)

> ## Enchancing performance: rationale
>
> How long will the example below take to run?
> ```
> command
> ```
> {: language-bash}
> 
>> ## Solution
>> This equates to a whole lifetime. As no-one is going to wait that long for a calculation to run, it provides the motivation we need to speed up the code we have in the best possible way.
